# MRogue
A generic roguelike template in Python.

### Description
This is an exercise in coding a turn-based game with text representation.
A Python port of libTCOD by [HexDecimal](https://github.com/HexDecimal) is used. Besides that only Numpy is required.

##### Goal
The aim of this project is two-fold: to learn and apply Python techniques, and to create a Minimum Viable Product for a
Rogue-like game which can be later extended and turned into an original experience and full feature game.

##### History
I have started working on a roguelike engine several years ago in ANSI C using ncurses. As I was learning and trying
different languages, this work was ported to C++ then Java and finally Python. It can still feel ancient in places or have
non-pythonic solutions and paradigms implemented. The code is constantly being rewritten and development is slow
because of other hobbies and interests taking up my free time.

### Features
Flow of the game is organised into turns, with player taking 1 turn to perform an action, and monsters performing their
actions all at once immediately after. Player can use items to fight monsters and reach the last level of the dungeon.
Available keyboard shortcuts are listed in the game's interface - displayed by pressing Shift+H.

### Instructions
`git clone git@github.com:kamil-n/mrogue.git`

`cd rogue`

`python3 -m venv ./venv`

`. venv/bin/activate`

`pip install numpy tcod`

`python3 rogue.py`

Release builds should also be available.
